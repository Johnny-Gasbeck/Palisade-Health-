## Project Background

**Founded in 2016, Palisade Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States**. **In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories** spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. Now that they’ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. 

## Project Goal
**As a data analyst at Row Health, your focus is on building visualizations** to enable the marketing team to self-serve insights and regular-cadence reporting.
The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of marketing campaigns at Palisade Health to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation for 2024 campaigns. 

The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to raise awareness of Palisade Health’s brand across the country and 2) to increase the number of customer signups.
